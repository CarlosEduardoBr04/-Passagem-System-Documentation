## 🎫 **Passagem System Documentation**

### Overview

The "Passagem" system is a Java console application designed to manage passenger and ticket information. It consists of two classes: `Passagem` and `Principal`. The system enables users to input and display details about passengers and their corresponding tickets.

### Classes

#### `Passagem` 🧑📝📋

This class encapsulates information related to passengers and their respective tickets. It features methods for capturing passenger details (`CadastrarPassageiro`), recording ticket information (`CadastrarPassagem`), and displaying the gathered data (`MostrarDadosPassageiro`, `MostrarPassagem`).

#### `Principal` 📋

The `Principal` class serves as the entry point for the program. It creates an instance of the `Passagem` class, allowing users to interact with the system by inputting passenger and ticket details through the console.

### Usage

1. **Passenger Information Input:**
   - Run the program.
   - Enter passenger details when prompted (name, phone, and RG).
   - View the entered passenger information.

2. **Ticket Information Input:**
   - Continue with the program.
   - Input ticket details when prompted (location, date, time, and seat number).
   - Observe the displayed ticket information.

### Purpose

This system is a basic illustration of a console-based passenger and ticket management application. It demonstrates fundamental Java concepts such as classes, methods, and user input/output.
